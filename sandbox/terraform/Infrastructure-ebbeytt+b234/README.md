Here is a draft README for a Terraform configuration to deploy an Image Builder service:

# Terraform Configuration for Azure Image Builder

This Terraform configuration sets up an Azure Image Builder service to automate OS image creation in Azure.

## Usage

To use this module, include something like the following in your Terraform configuration:

```
module "imagebuilder" {
  source = "github.com/myorg/imagebuilder-module"
  
  resource_group_name = "my-resource-group"
  location = "East US"
  
  // Additional parameters  
}
```

## Requirements

- An existing Azure resource group
- Permissions to create/manage the following resource types:
  - Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates
  - Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageBuilderServices

## What's included

This module creates the following resources:

- An Azure Image Builder service
- An image template for building custom VM images 
- Additional resources as needed (e.g. shared image gallery, managed identity)

## Usage

Once the Terraform apply completes successfully, the image builder service can be used to start image builds as needed. The image template can be reused and parameterized to output images to your shared image gallery.

Some common usage patterns:

- Schedule image builds using the Azure CLI/API
- Trigger image builds from a CI/CD pipeline
- Customize the OS with additional software using the image template

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default |  
|--|--|--|--|
| `resource_group_name` | Name of the resource group | string | - |
| `location` | Azure region for deployment | string | - |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| `image_builder_id` | Resource ID of the image builder service |
| `image_template_id` | Resource ID of the image template |
