Here is a draft README for a Terraform configuration with EC2, RDS, and SSM resources:

# Terraform AWS Infrastructure

This Terraform configuration sets up basic AWS infrastructure including:

- EC2 instances
- RDS database instance
- SSM parameter store parameters

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with credentials to deploy to your AWS account

2. Initialize Terraform:

```
terraform init
```

3. Review and update `terraform.tfvars` with your AWS details

4. View changes to be made: 

```
terraform plan
```

5. Apply changes:

```
terraform apply
```

6. When finished with infrastructure, destroy resources: 

```
terraform destroy
```

## Resources Created

- EC2 instance(s) based on `ec2.tf`
- RDS PostgreSQL database instance based on `rds.tf` 
- SSM parameters for database credentials based on `ssm.tf`

## Next Steps

Some ideas for next steps:

- Add additional security groups, roles, policies as needed
- Consider making RDS instance multi-AZ for high availability
- Monitor EC2 and RDS metrics with CloudWatch dashboards
- Store secrets like database passwords in AWS Secrets Manager instead of SSM
