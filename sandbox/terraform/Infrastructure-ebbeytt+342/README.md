Here is a draft README for a Terraform configuration to deploy an Image Builder and Transit Gateway:

# Terraform Configuration for Image Builder and Transit Gateway

## Overview

This Terraform configuration deploys the following resources:

- Image Builder - Used to automate the creation, maintenance, validation, and distribution of VM images.

- Transit Gateway - Acts as a hub that controls how traffic flows between all the VPCs and on-premises networks. 

## Usage

1. Ensure Terraform is installed

2. Configure AWS provider credentials in `provider.tf`

3. Update `variables.tf` with your AWS region, VPC IDs, subnet IDs etc

4. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory 

5. Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes Terraform will make

6. Run `terraform apply` to deploy resources

## Resources

- `imagebuilder.tf` - Defines the Image Builder component resource

- `transitgateway.tf` - Defines the Transit Gateway resource, attachments to VPCs

- `outputs.tf` - Defines output variables for resources deployed 

- `variables.tf` - Input variables for Terraform module

## Requirements

- Terraform 0.12+

- AWS provider 3.0+

- VPC and subnets should exist 

Let me know if you would like any changes or have additional requirements for the README. I tried to cover the key points but can add more details if needed.
