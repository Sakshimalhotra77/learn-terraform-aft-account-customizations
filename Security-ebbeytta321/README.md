# AWS Security Services Configuration with Terraform

This Terraform configuration provisions the following AWS security services:

- Amazon Inspector
- Amazon GuardDuty
- AWS Security Hub

## Prerequisites

Before using this Terraform configuration, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine
- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage the required resources

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or create a new directory for your Terraform configuration.
2. Copy the `main.tf` file from this repository into your directory.
3. (Optional) Modify the `main.tf` file to customize the configuration according to your requirements.
4. Initialize the Terraform working directory by running the following command:

   ```
   terraform init
   ```

5. Review the execution plan by running the following command:

   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

6. If the plan looks good, apply the configuration by running the following command:

   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

   This will provision the specified AWS security services in your account.

7. To destroy the provisioned resources and remove them from your account, run the following command:

   ```
   terraform destroy
   ```

## main.tf

The `main.tf` file contains the Terraform configuration for the requested AWS security services. It defines the resources to be provisioned and their settings.

```hcl
# Amazon Inspector
resource "aws_inspector_resource_group" "example" {
  # Configuration for Amazon Inspector Resource Group
}

resource "aws_inspector_assessment_target" "example" {
  # Configuration for Amazon Inspector Assessment Target
