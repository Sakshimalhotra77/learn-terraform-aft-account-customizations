Here is a draft README for a Terraform configuration to set up AWS CloudTrail based on the user request:

# AWS CloudTrail Terraform Configuration

## Overview

This Terraform configuration sets up AWS CloudTrail to enable logging and monitoring of API calls made to your AWS account. 

## Features

- Enables CloudTrail across all regions
- Creates an S3 bucket to store the CloudTrail log files
- Configures a CloudWatch log group and log stream for the CloudTrail logs
- Sets up trail event selectors to log management events and data events
- Enables log file validation to detect tampering

## Usage

1. Ensure Terraform is installed
2. Configure your AWS credentials in the provider block
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory 
4. Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes
5. Run `terraform apply` to set up AWS CloudTrail

The S3 bucket name and CloudWatch log group name are generated dynamically. Review the `output.tf` file to see the names generated.

## Resources Created

- `aws_cloudtrail` resource to enable CloudTrail
- `aws_s3_bucket` resource for storing log files  
- `aws_cloudwatch_log_group` resource to store and monitor log events
- IAM roles and policies to allow CloudTrail to interact with S3 and CloudWatch

## Requirements 

- AWS provider >= 2.0
- Terraform >= 0.12
