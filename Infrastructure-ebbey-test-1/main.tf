To meet the requirements for the Sandbox environment with EC2 instances, we can create a Terraform configuration that includes the necessary modules and resources. Here's an example:

```hcl
# Define the provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# VPC Module
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~> 3.0"

  name = "sandbox-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24", "10.0.103.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway = true
  enable_vpn_gateway = false

  tags = {
    CostCenter = "3012"
  }
}

# Security Group Module
module "security_group" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws"
  version = "~> 4.0"

  name        = "allow-ssh"
  description = "Allow SSH inbound traffic"
  vpc_id      = module.vpc.vpc_id

  ingress_with_cidr_blocks = [
    {
      from_port   = 22
      to_port     = 22
      protocol    = "tcp"
      description = "SSH access"
      cidr_blocks = "YOUR_IP/32" # Replace with your IP address
    },
  ]

  tags = {
    CostCenter = "3012"
  }
}

# EC2 Module
module "ec2" {
  source  = "your-org-name/ec2/aws"
  version = "~> 1.0.0"

  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ami           = "ami-0cff7528ff583bf9a" # Replace with the latest AMI ID
  count         = 2

  vpc_id                  = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_id               = module.vpc.private_subnets[0]
  security_group_id       = module.security_group.security_group_id
  enable_monitoring       = true
  enable_t2_unlimited     = true # Enable T2/T3 Unlimited for t2.micro instances

  tags = {
    CostCenter = "3012"
  }
}
```

In this configuration, we have the following:

1. **Provider Definition**: We define the AWS provider and specify the region as `us-east-1`.

2. **VPC Module**: We use the `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws` module to create a VPC with private and public subnets. The `CostCenter` tag is added to the VPC.

3. **Security Group Module**: We use the `terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws` module to create a security group that allows SSH access from your IP address. The `CostCenter` tag is added to the security group.

4. **EC2 Module**: We use the `your-org-name/ec2/aws` module to provision EC2 instances in the private subnet. The required parameters `instance_type`, `ami`, and `count` are provided. The `enable_t2_unlimited` parameter is set to `true` to enable T2/T3 Unlimited for `t2.micro` instances. We also enable detailed monitoring for better insights. The `CostCenter` tag is added to the EC2 instances.

Please note that you need to replace `YOUR_IP/32` with your actual IP address in the security group module to allow SSH access from your IP. Additionally, you should update the `ami` parameter with the latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID for your desired operating system and region.

This Terraform configuration follows best practices, such as using modules for reusability and maintainability, separating resources into logical modules, and adding relevant tags. Additionally, it includes comments explaining the purpose of each module and resource.
